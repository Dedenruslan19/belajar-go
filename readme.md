# Graded Challenge 2 V2 - P1

Graded Challenge ini dibuat guna mengevaluasi pembelajaran pada Hacktiv8 Program Fulltime Golang khususnya pada pembelajaran concurrent golang

## Assignment Directions

### Release 1 : Concurrent Random Number Generator

Write a program in Golang that creates 5 concurrent goroutines. Each goroutine should print its ID and a random number between 1 and 100. The program should terminate when all goroutines have completed.

Instructions:

- The program should create 5 concurrent goroutines.
- Each goroutine should generate and print its unique ID (you can use Goroutine IDs or other identifiers) and a random number between 1 and 100.
- The random numbers generated by different goroutines can be the same; there's no need to ensure they are distinct.
- The program should wait for all goroutines to complete before terminating.

You can use the go keyword to create goroutines and synchronization mechanisms like channels or WaitGroups to ensure all goroutines finish their work before the program exits.

For example, the program output might look like this:

## Release 2 : Concurrent URL Checker

Write a program in Golang that checks the status of multiple URLs concurrently. The program should take a list of URLs as input and then use goroutines to make HTTP GET requests to each URL to check if it's reachable. For each URL, the program should print whether it's reachable or not.

Instructions:

The program should accept a list of URLs (e.g., as strings in a slice) as input.

Create a concurrent goroutine for each URL to check its reachability. You can use the net/http package for making HTTP GET requests.

Each goroutine should print the URL and whether it's reachable 
(e.g., "URL: https://example.com is reachable" or "URL: https://example.com is not reachable").

The program should wait for all goroutines to complete before terminating.

Implement error handling for cases where a URL is not reachable or there's an issue with the HTTP request.

For example, if you provide a list of URLs like :
["https://h4cktiv8.com","https://google.com","https://nonexistenturl.com","https://hacktiv8.com","https://github.com",],the program output might look like this:

Push Assigment yang telah Anda buat ke akun Github Classroom Anda masing-masing.

Please notes :

- Don't rush through the problem or try to solve it all at once.

- Don't copy and paste code from external sources without fully understanding how it works.

- Don't hardcode values or rely on assumptions that may not hold true in all 
cases.

- Don't forget to handle error cases or edge cases, such as invalid input or unexpected behavior.

- Don't hesitate to refactor your code or make improvements based on feedback or new insights.
