# Graded Challenge 3 V2 - P1

Graded Challenge ini dibuat guna mengevaluasi pembelajaran pada Hacktiv8 Program Fulltime Golang khususnya pada pembelajaran SQL.

## Assignment Objectives

Graded Challenge 3 ini dibuat guna mengevaluasi pemahaman SQL sebagai berikut:

- Mampu memahami konsep intermediate query SQL
- Mampu melakukan implementasi ERD

### Assignment Directions

Develop a relational database schema for a healthcare facility using SQL. The database should include the following tables:

- Patients - stores patient information such as ID, name, date of birth, and address.
- Doctors - stores doctor information such as ID, name, specialization, and room number.
- Appointments - stores appointment information such as appointment ID, patient ID, doctor ID, and appointment date.
- Treatments - stores information on treatments prescribed, including treatment ID, name, and description.
- Billing - stores billing information including billing ID, patient ID, treatment ID, and amount billed.

Instructions:

- Define appropriate primary and foreign keys for each table.
- Set up relationships between tables with the correct cardinality and optionality.
- Ensure that the database schema adheres to at least the third normal form to avoid unnecessary data redundancy.

Construct SQL queries to retrieve the following information:

- a. Retrieve the names of patients who have appointments with a particular doctor.
- b. Calculate the total billing amount for a particular patient.
- c. List the doctors who currently have no appointments scheduled.
- d. Find the treatments prescribed most frequently.
