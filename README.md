## Graded Challenge 1 V2 - P1

Graded Challenge ini dibuat guna mengevaluasi pembelajaran pada Hacktiv8 Program Fulltime Golang khususnya pada pembelajaran logika pemogramman dengan conditional dan looping.

Soal terdiri dari 3 Challenges :

- 1.Challenge Conditional
- 2.Challenge Looping
- 3.Challenge Conditional & Looping

## Assignment Objectives Graded Challenge 1 ini dibuat guna mengevaluasi pemahaman golang basic sebagai berikut:

- Mampu memahami konsep conditional
- Mampu melakukan implementasi logika pemogramman dengan conditional
- Mampu memahami konsep looping
- Mampu melakukan implementasi logika pemogramman dengan looping

## Assignment Directions

### 1 Conditional

Write a program in Golang that takes a numerical grade as input and prints one of the following messages based on the grade:

- If the grade is between 90 and 100 (inclusive), print "A: Excellent".
- If the grade is between 80 and 89, print "B: Good".
- If the grade is between 70 and 79, print "C: Satisfactory".
- If the grade is between 60 and 69, print "D: Needs Improvement".
- If the grade is below 60, print "F: Fail".
- If the input is not a valid numerical grade (e.g., a string or a grade outside the 0-100 range), print "Invalid grade input".

Your program should handle both integer and floating-point input values for grades and ensure that it covers all possible input scenarios.

### 2. Looping

Write a program in Golang that finds and prints all prime numbers within a given range. The program should take two positive integer inputs: a lower bound and an upper bound. It should then find all prime numbers between the lower and upper bounds (inclusive) and print them.

A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that is divisible only by 1 and itself.

For example:

- If the lower bound is 10 and the upper bound is 50, the program should print all prime numbers between 10 and 50.

Your program should utilize loops to check each number in the specified range for primality and print the prime numbers found.

### 3. Conditional & Looping

Write a program in Golang that repeatedly prompts the user for an integer and then outputs whether that integer is even or odd. After each evaluation, the program should prompt the user to continue or quit. If the user chooses to continue, the program should prompt for another integer; otherwise, the program should terminate.

Instructions:

The program should repeatedly do the following:

- Prompt the user to enter an integer.
- Output whether the entered integer is even or odd.
- Prompt the user to continue or quit.
- If the user enters a valid integer, the program should correctly determine if it's even or odd.
- If the user chooses to continue, the program should repeat the process.
- If the user chooses to quit, the program should terminate.

The program should handle invalid input gracefully. If the user enters something that's not a valid integer, it should display an error message and prompt the user to enter a valid input.

The program should handle both positive and negative integers.

For example, the program execution might look like this:

Please notes :

- Don't rush through the problem or try to solve it all at once.
- Don't copy and paste code from external sources without fully understanding how it works.
- Don't hardcode values or rely on assumptions that may not hold true in all cases.
- Don't forget to handle error cases or edge cases, such as invalid input or unexpected behavior.
- Don't hesitate to refactor your code or make improvements based on feedback or new insights.
